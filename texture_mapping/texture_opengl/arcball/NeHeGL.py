# NeHe Tutorial Lesson: 48 - ArcBall Rotation
#
# C version of tutorial by Terence J. Grant
# This code was created by Jeff Molofee 2000
# Ported to PyOpenGL 2.0 by Brian Leair 2004
#
# The port was based on the PyOpenGL tutorials and from 
# PyOpenGLContext (tests/glprint.py)
#
# If you've found this code useful, feel free to let me know 
# at (Brian Leair telcom_sage@yahoo.com).
#
# See original source and C based tutorial at http://nehe.gamedev.net
#
# Note:
# -----
# This code is not an ideal example of Pythonic coding or use of OO 
# techniques. It is a simple and direct exposition of how to use the 
# Open GL API in Python via the PyOpenGL package. It also uses GLUT, 
# a high quality platform independent library. Due to using these APIs, 
# this code is more like a C program using procedural programming.
#
# To run this example you will need:
# Python 	- www.python.org (v 2.3 as of 1/2004)
# PyOpenGL 	- pyopengl.sourceforge.net (v 2.0.1.07 as of 1/2004)
# Numeric Python	- (v.22 of "numpy" as of 1/2004) numpy.sourceforge.net
#

from texture_opengl.arcball.Lesson48 import *		# Draw (), Initialize () and all the real OpenGL work.
from texture_opengl.arcball.ArcBall import *		# // *NEW* ArcBall header


# *********************** Globals *********************** 
# Python 2.2 defines these directly
# Some api in the chain is translating the keystrokes to this octal string
# so instead of saying: ESCAPE = 27, we use the following.
ESCAPE = '\033'

	glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)				# Enables Depth Testing
	glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL)				# The Type Of Depth Test To Do
	glHint (GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, GL_NICEST) # Really Nice Perspective Calculations

   	# Register the drawing function with glut, BUT in Python land, at least using PyOpenGL, we need to

	# We've told Glut the type of window we want, and we've told glut about
	# various functions that we want invoked (idle, resizing, keyboard events).

	# tying in a rendering context, so we are ready to start making immediate mode
	# GL calls.
